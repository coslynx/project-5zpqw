# Software Log Management Desktop App

## Project Overview
- Develop a simple desktop app for presenting software logs in a tabular format with search, sort, filter, and highlight functionalities.
- The app will be able to read logs from a file that is constantly updated or directly from the terminal.

## Features
- Tabular Display: Present logs in a structured table format for easy readability.
- Search Functionality: Allow users to search for specific keywords within the logs.
- Sort Logs: Provide the option to sort logs based on different criteria such as timestamp or log level.
- Filter Logs: Enable users to filter logs based on specific criteria like log level or message content.
- Highlighting: Allow users to highlight certain logs based on keywords or criteria.
- Real-time Updates: Continuously update logs in real-time when reading from a constantly updated file.
- Terminal Integration: Ability to read logs directly from the terminal assuming logs are generated by another process.
- Customization: Provide options for users to customize the display settings based on their preferences.
- Export Function: Allow users to export logs to a file for further analysis or sharing.
- User-friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for seamless log management.

## Enhancements
- Implement a feature to save and load different log configurations for convenience.
- Incorporate a dark mode option for users who prefer a different color scheme.
- Include the ability to track log trends over time for better analysis.
- Integrate a feature for setting alerts based on certain log conditions for proactive monitoring.
- Enable users to bookmark important logs for quick access in the future.

## Programming Languages
- Python for backend logic and data processing.
- JavaScript with Electron for building the desktop application.

## APIs
- Electron API for creating native desktop applications.
- Node.js File System API for reading logs from a file.
- Search API for implementing search functionality.
- Sort and Filter APIs for arranging and filtering logs.
- Highlight API for highlighting specific logs.
- Export API for exporting logs to a file.

## Packages and Libraries
- Electron (v14.0.0) for building cross-platform desktop apps.
- React (v17.0.2) for creating the user interface.
- Bootstrap (v5.1.0) for styling the application.
- Moment.js (v2.29.1) for handling timestamps.
- Lodash (v4.17.21) for utility functions.
- Electron-log (v4.2.5) for logging in Electron apps.

## Technical Choices Rationale
- Python was chosen for its ease of use in handling file operations and data processing.
- JavaScript with Electron was selected for its ability to create desktop applications using web technologies.
- Electron API provides access to native desktop features required for the application.
- Node.js File System API enables reading logs from a file efficiently.
- React was chosen for its component-based architecture and ease of building interactive user interfaces.
- Moment.js simplifies handling and formatting timestamps in the logs.
- Lodash provides useful utility functions for data manipulation.
- Electron-log assists in logging within the Electron application.

## Conclusion
By combining Python for backend operations, JavaScript with Electron for the desktop app, and various APIs and libraries for enhanced functionality, the project aims to deliver a robust and user-friendly software log management application with advanced features for efficient log analysis and monitoring.
